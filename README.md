Specular lighting is responsible for creating the effect of a shiny surface. Essentially, the brighter the spot on our object, the more aligned the reflected light direction and surface normal. The formula used for determining the reflection direction is derived from the [law of reflection](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-shading/reflection-refraction-fresnel).
